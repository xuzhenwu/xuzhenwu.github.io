I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. From 2020 to 2024, I completed my Ph.D. at the UCAS under the supervision of [**Yongqiang Zhang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t5iGFeAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) ([**Âº†Ê∞∏Âº∫**](https://igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrck/kygg/bjdbgc/201903/t20190327_5262230.html)), during which I also spent part of my training at TU Wien with Prof. [**G√ºnter Bl√∂schl**](https://www.waterresources.at/index.php?id=99). I currently work in Prof. Zhang‚Äôs Global Water Resources Team and collaborate with international researchers on diverse hydrological topics, with a global perspective.

My research focuses on **hydrology and water cycle resilience**. In particular, I study how hydrological systems sustain resilience under disturbances and avoid irreversible regime shifts, especially those triggered by droughts and wildfires. I integrate satellite observations, field measurements, and distributed ecohydrological modeling to investigate mechanisms of water balance change, hydrological responses, and vegetation‚Äìhydrology feedbacks.

I also work on data and methodological development, including the development, updating, and application of [**PML-V2**](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CAS_IGSNRR_PML_V2_v018), a diagnostic global evapotranspiration model. In earlier studies, I developed parallel algorithms for distributed hydrological models and evaluated model uncertainty under different routing schemes.

**I welcome collaborations and discussions on any hydrology-related topics!**

# Lastest News

We warmly welcome contributions to our proposing session on **drought responses** at Vienna, EGU 2026!
This session, convened by Zhenwu Xu (ECS), Shuping Li (ECS), Wantong Li (ECS), Yongqiang Zhang, and Diego G. Miralles, aims to bring together researchers studying ecohydrological responses to droughts in a changing environment.

**Session short summary**
Ecohydrological processes are increasingly influenced by frequent, prolonged, and severe droughts under climate and land surface changes. This session welcomes studies using observations, models, and concepts to explore mechanisms, trends, resilience, and impacts of drought responses, aiming to inform adaptation strategies in a changing environment.
