I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2024, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (supervisor: [Yongqiang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t5iGFeAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)). I currently work in Prof. Zhang's Global Water Resources Team and collaborate with international researchers on diverse aspects of hydrology, gaining broad global perspectives.

My research focuses on hydrology and water cycle resilience, with particular interest in understanding how extreme events such as droughts and wildfires affect ecosystems and water fluxes. I integrate satellite observations, field measurements, and distributed ecohydrological modeling to investigate the mechanisms of water balance changes, hydrological responses, and vegetationâ€“hydrology feedbacks.

I also focus on data and methodological development, including the development, updating, and application of PML-V2, a diagnostic global evapotranspiration datasets, as well as parallel algorithms for distributed hydrological models and the evaluation of model uncertainty under different routing schemes.

## Research Interests

* Water balance responses to disturbances (droughts, wildfires, deforestation, LULC, human intervention, tropical cyclones etc.)

* Long-term trends and resilience of ecohydrological systems under recuring stress from disturbances

* Process-based modelling of evapotranspiration and streamflow

* Integration of satellite observations and field data for hydrological monitoring
