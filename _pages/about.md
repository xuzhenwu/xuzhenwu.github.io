I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2024, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (supervisor: [**Yongqiang Zhang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t5iGFeAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) [**Âº†Ê∞∏Âº∫**](https://igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrck/kygg/bjdbgc/201903/t20190327_5262230.html)). I currently work in Prof. Zhang's Global Water Resources Team and collaborate with international researchers on diverse aspects of hydrology, gaining broad global perspectives.

My research focuses on **hydrology and water cycle resilience**, with particular interest in understanding how extreme events such as droughts and wildfires affect ecosystems and water fluxes. I integrate satellite observations, field measurements, and distributed ecohydrological modeling to investigate the mechanisms of water balance changes, hydrological responses, and vegetation‚Äìhydrology feedbacks. 

I also focus on data and methodological development, including the development, updating, and application of [**PML-V2**](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CAS_IGSNRR_PML_V2_v018), a diagnostic global evapotranspiration model, as well as parallel algorithms for distributed hydrological models and the evaluation of model uncertainty under different routing schemes.

We warmly welcome contributions to our session on **drought responses** at Vienna, EGU 2026! 
This session, convened by Zhenwu Xu (ECS), Shuping Li (ECS), Wantong Li (ECS), Yongqiang Zhang, and Diego G. Miralles, aims to bring together researchers studying ecohydrological responses to droughts in a changing environment.

**Session short summary**
Ecohydrological processes are increasingly influenced by frequent, prolonged, and severe droughts under climate and land surface changes. This session welcomes studies using observations, models, and concepts to explore mechanisms, trends, resilience, and impacts of drought responses, aiming to inform adaptation strategies in a changing environment.
