The 2019–2020 mega forest fires in southeast Australia significantly increased flood peak discharges for two years post-fire. Fire impacts were strongest in regions with winter-dominated, uniform rainfall, while negligible where summer-dominated rainfall prevailed. These results suggest that burned areas exacerbate infiltration-excess runoff, highlighting increasing flood risk in fire-prone regions under climate change.
