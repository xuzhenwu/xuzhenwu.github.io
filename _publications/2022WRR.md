Bushfires can strongly alter hydrological fluxes, yet their effect on water balance remains poorly quantified. Using a modified paired catchment approach, we assessed fire-induced changes in eight Victorian forested catchments affected by the 2009 fires (12%–89% burned). Over the post-fire decade, evapotranspiration declined by 33 ± 20 mm yr⁻¹, while streamflow increased by 68 ± 32 mm yr⁻¹. Evapotranspiration gradually recovered after the first year, whereas streamflow peaked in years two to three. These asynchronous responses suggest an initial increase and later decrease in terrestrial water storage, with an overall post-fire decline relative to unburned catchments.
