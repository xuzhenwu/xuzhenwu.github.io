This study introduces an automatic partition-based parallel algorithm (APPA) to enhance the efficiency of grid-based distributed hydrological models. By combining flexible domain decomposition with load-balanced parallel simulation, APPA optimizes hillslope and channel flow routing at sub-basin and channel unit levels. Embedded in a distributed ecohydrological model and tested across three watersheds, APPA achieved 91–98% of the theoretical maximum speedup using 26 threads, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating model simulations.
